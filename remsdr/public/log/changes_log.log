- Adaptive RX audio buffer size according to the quality of the Internet link.
- Waterfall on RX audio spectrum

Version 4.3 (January 2022)
***********
- RX Audio. Second output filtered or not to connect an external software via a VB cable for example
- TX Audio. Possibility to select microphone or external input via VB cable for example
- Omnirig Interface to drive the frequency and the transmit order from an external software (ex MMSSTV, WSJT-X..)

Version 4.2 (December 2021)
***********
- Remove ScriptProcessorNode in RX and TX Audio which is deprecated and replaced by AudioWorkletNode.
- Introduce CTCSS oscillator based on a Oscillator Node.
- Equalizer for the TX microphone.
- Equalizer, Notch filter and Noise filter for the RX Audio.
- Direct RX audio, without filtering, from demodulation to the output to speaker or virtual cable.
- Reduction around 100ms of RX latency.
- Page layout modifications
- Possibility to display external pages in an iframe. To be defined in configurationRX.js page
- Example: GS 232 rotator control in an iframe
